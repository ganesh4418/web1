In the fintech industry, payment gateway companies face numerous challenges in processing transactions involving multiple mobile wallet companies across the African continent. One of the key challenges is the need to process reversal requests raised by customers for various reasons, such as wrong amount, wrong receiving person, or accidental transaction. These requests can be difficult to process using traditional methods, as they involve a large number of different sending and receiving partner companies."

The roadmap identified several key steps that needed to be automated, including identifying and categorising reversal requests, structuring the reversal tickets, extracting necessary information from the tickets, and automating actions to be taken in case of human delays in handling manual stages.",
          "At Beauto Systems, we leveraged our expertise in Natural Language Programming and fundamental Java code to implement the automation roadmap. This allowed us to reduce the cost of using paid tools for RPA to the maximum possible extent. We also created a simple and highly interactive UI at a rapid pace to monitor and control the entire reversal process and deployed the entire system on the client's on-premise server.",

We believe that by leveraging the power of RPA, companies can not only achieve significant cost savings but also improve their overall business efficiency."
